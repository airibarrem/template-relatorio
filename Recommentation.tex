\chapter{Preliminary Recommendations} \label{ch:recom}


Forest and landscape restoration aims to conserve biodiversity, safeguard essential ecosystem services for human well-being, and achieve social and economic benefits. Here, we recommend a series of best practices to guide decision makers, scientists and practitioners to achieve these goals and scale-up restoration. We identified these practices based on our results and on literature review focused on lessons learned and drivers for success of restoration initiatives. The ideal framework considers a transdisciplinary, participatory and adaptive management approach. 

The FLR mindset includes biophysical and socioeconomic aspects, as described on Table \ref{table:recommend}, and demands: (i) a better picture of social and environmental perceptions, (ii) multistakeholders involvement, (iii) socio-economic benefits evaluation and promotion, (iv) technical assistance, (v) spatial planning, (vi) attention to ecosystem services provision (as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and water security), (vii) monitoring at multiple scales, (viii) communication and knowledge transfer. These practices can facilitate, stimulate and optimize restoration actions, reducing restoration costs and associated conflicts while optimizing its benefits.

% \section{Diretrizes para formuladores de políticas estaduais/federais}\label{sec:politcs}

% Well-preserved forests should be conserved and expanded, yet adopting more environmentally friendly land management practices in agricultural landscapes is a good complementary strategy. Policies focused on environmentally-friendly land management practices and FLR should advocate for the use of biodiverse agroforestry systems. The Native Vegetation Protection Law (N° 12.651/2012) allows the use of agroforestry systems to recover environmental debts in private rural properties, but do not recommend the type of agroforestry to be implemented. We recommend that biodiverse agroforestry should be favored over simple agroforestry systems as they can both provide higher values of biodiversity recovery (this report) and be more profitable (Miccolis et al. 2016).

% We highlights the importance of incorporating landowners’ decision on forest restoration into spatial prioritization, but considering the ecological processes that occurs at the landscape scale, such as landscape connectivity.
